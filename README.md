Hello viewers!

This repository is basically the code base of my final year under graduate academic project done by a team of 4. This repository has a lot of junk python notebooks. The project is about developing a network anomaly detection model using graph analytics. The dataset used is UNSW-NB15 computer network security dataset. 

Please reach out to me if you have any suggestions :)

Thanks for your time and wishing you a good day!
